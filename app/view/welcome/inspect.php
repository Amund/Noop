<p>Calling <code>noop::start()</code> populate the noop registry with all the details of the request. It's important to check the current state of your app during its development.</p>
<p>You can view parts of this registry anywhere in your code, for example with <code>noop::inspect( 'app' )</code><p>
<?=noop::inspect( 'app' )?>

<p>More precisely with a <code>noop::inspect( 'request' )</code></p>
<?=noop::inspect( 'request' )?>

<p>Even more precisely with a path, like <code>noop::inspect( 'config/path/controller' )</code></p>
<?=noop::inspect( 'config/path/controller' )?>
